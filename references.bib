This article argues that between the industrial revolution and the digital revolution is a more valuable, yet overlooked period: the probabilistic revolution that began with the avalanche of printed numbers between 1820 and 1840. By comparing the many similarities between big data today and the avalanche of numbers in the 1800s, the article situates big data in the early stages of a prolonged transition to a potentially transformative epistemic revolution, like the probabilistic revolution. The widespread changes in and characteristics of a society flooded by data results in a transitional state that creates unique challenges for policy efforts by disrupting foundational principles relied upon for data protection. The potential of a widespread, lengthy transition also places the law in a pivotal position to shape and guide big data-based inquiry through to whatever epistemic shift may lie ahead.},

Overall, this review aims to be a handy overview for immunologists on how to design, develop and read HDcyto data.},

  abstract = {Very different influenza seasons have been observed from 2008/09\textendash 2011/12 in England and Wales, with the reported burden varying overall and by age group. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of influenza on all-cause and cause-specific mortality during this period. Age-specific generalised linear regression models fitted with an identity link were developed, modelling weekly influenza activity through multiplying clinical influenza-like illness consultation rates with proportion of samples positive for influenza A or B. To adjust for confounding factors, a similar activity indicator was calculated for Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Extreme temperature and seasonal trend were controlled for. Following a severe influenza season in 2008/09 in 65+yr olds (estimated excess of 13,058 influenza A all-cause deaths), attributed all-cause mortality was not significant during the 2009 pandemic in this age group and comparatively low levels of influenza A mortality were seen in post-pandemic seasons. The age shift of the burden of seasonal influenza from the elderly to young adults during the pandemic continued into 2010/11; a comparatively larger impact was seen with the same circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 strain, with the burden of influenza A all-cause excess mortality in 15\textendash 64 yr olds the largest reported during 2008/09\textendash 2011/12 (436 deaths in 15\textendash 44 yr olds and 1,274 in 45\textendash 64 yr olds). On average, 76\% of seasonal influenza A all-age attributable deaths had a cardiovascular or respiratory cause recorded (average of 5,849 influenza A deaths per season), with nearly a quarter reported for other causes (average of 1,770 influenza A deaths per season), highlighting the importance of all-cause as well as cause-specific estimates. No significant influenza B attributable mortality was detected by season, cause or age group. This analysis forms part of the preparatory work to establish a routine mortality monitoring system ahead of introduction of the UK universal childhood seasonal influenza vaccination programme in 2013/14.},

  abstract = {Background Estimates of influenza-associated mortality are important for national and international decision making on public health priorities. Previous estimates of 250,000\textendash 500,000 annual influenza deaths are outdated. We updated the estimated number of global annual influenza-associated respiratory deaths using country-specific influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality estimates from 1999\textendash 2015. Methods We estimated country-specific influenza-associated respiratory excess mortality rates (EMR) for 33 countries using time series log-linear regression models with vital death records and influenza surveillance data. To extrapolate estimates to countries without data, we divided countries into three analytic divisions for three age groups ({$<$}65 years, 65\textendash 74 years, and {$\geq$}75 years) using WHO Global Health Estimate (GHE) respiratory infection mortality rates. We calculated mortality rate ratios (MRR) to account for differences in risk of influenza death across countries by comparing GHE respiratory infection mortality rates from countries without EMR estimates with those with estimates. To calculate death estimates for individual countries within each age-specific analytic division, we multiplied randomly selected mean annual EMRs by the country's MRR and population. Global 95\% credible interval (CrI) estimates were obtained from the posterior distribution of the sum of country-specific estimates to represent the range of possible influenza-associated deaths in a season or year. We calculated influenza-associated deaths for children younger than 5 years for 92 countries with high rates of mortality due to respiratory infection using the same methods. Findings EMR-contributing countries represented 57\% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranged from 0{$\cdot$}1 to 6{$\cdot$}4 per 100,000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2{$\cdot$}9 to 44{$\cdot$}0 per 100,000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17{$\cdot$}9 to 223{$\cdot$}5 per 100,000 for people older than 75 years. We estimated that 291,243\textendash 645,832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths (4{$\cdot$}0\textendash 8{$\cdot$}8 per 100,000 individuals) occur annually. The highest mortality rates were estimated in sub-Saharan Africa (2{$\cdot$}8\textendash 16{$\cdot$}5 per 100,000 individuals), southeast Asia (3{$\cdot$}5\textendash 9{$\cdot$}2 per 100,000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51{$\cdot$}3\textendash 99{$\cdot$}4 per 100,000 individuals). For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243\textendash 105,690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. Interpretation These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated. Funding None.},

For 92 countries, we estimated that among children younger than 5 years, 9243\textendash 105,690 influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. Interpretation These global influenza-associated respiratory mortality estimates are higher than previously reported, suggesting that previous estimates might have underestimated disease burden. The contribution of non-respiratory causes of death to global influenza-associated mortality should be investigated. Funding None.},

However, previous methods either operate on a predefined set of face attributes or leave users little freedom to interactively manipulate images. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework termed MaskGAN, enabling diverse and interactive face manipulation. Our key insight is that semantic masks serve as a suitable intermediate representation for flexible face manipulation with fidelity preservation. MaskGAN has two main components: 1) Dense Mapping Network (DMN) and 2) Editing Behavior Simulated Training (EBST). Specifically, DMN learns style mapping between a free-form user modified mask and a target image, enabling diverse generation results. EBST models the user editing behavior on the source mask, making the overall framework more robust to various manipulated inputs. Specifically, it introduces dual-editing consistency as the auxiliary supervision signal. To facilitate extensive studies, we construct a large-scale high-resolution face dataset with fine-grained mask annotations named CelebAMask-HQ. MaskGAN is comprehensively evaluated on two challenging tasks: attribute transfer and style copy, demonstrating superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods.

It means that the model, once being trained, can be used to handle all these tasks. The existing task-specific methods mainly use 2D keypoints (pose) to estimate the human body structure. However, they only express the position information with no abilities to characterize the personalized shape of the person and model the limb rotations. In this paper, we propose to use a 3D body mesh recovery module to disentangle the pose and shape. It can not only model the joint location and rotation but also characterize the personalized body shape. To preserve the source information, such as texture, style, color, and face identity, we propose an Attentional Liquid Warping GAN with Attentional Liquid Warping Block (AttLWB) that propagates the source information in both image and feature spaces to the synthesized reference. Specifically, the source features are extracted by a denoising convolutional auto-encoder for characterizing the source identity well. Furthermore, our proposed method can support a more flexible warping from multiple sources. To further improve the generalization ability of the unseen source images, a one/few-shot adversarial learning is applied. In detail, it firstly trains a model in an extensive training set. Then, it finetunes the model by one/few-shot unseen image(s) in a self-supervised way to generate high-resolution (512 \texttimes{} 512 and 1024 \texttimes{} 1024) results. Also, we build a new dataset, namely Impersonator (iPER) dataset, for the evaluation of human motion imitation, appearance transfer, and novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in terms of preserving face identity, shape consistency, and clothes details. All codes and dataset are available on https://impersonator.org/work/impersonator-plus-plus.html.},

To overcome some limitations of the current metrics, we also propose several data sets on which precision and recall can be computed.

(2) Methods: We take a design science research approach and select the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) as the AutoML method based on a benchmark test and requirements from researcher-physicians. We then integrate TPOT into two artefacts: a web application and a notebook. We evaluate these artefacts with researcher-physicians to examine which approach suits researcher-physicians best. Both artefacts have a similar workflow, but different user interfaces because of a conflict in requirements. (3) Results: Artefact A, a web application, was perceived as better for uploading a dataset and comparing results. Artefact B, a Jupyter notebook, was perceived as better regarding the workflow and being in control of model construction. (4) Conclusions: Thus, a hybrid artefact would be best for researcher-physicians. However, both artefacts missed model explainability and an explanation of variable importance for their created models. Hence, deployment of AutoML technologies in healthcare remains currently limited to the exploratory data analysis phase.},

  abstract = {Deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained via gradient-based learning algorithms, namely backpropagation. Evolution strategies (ES) can rival backprop-based algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradients on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems. However, ES can be considered a gradient-based algorithm because it performs stochastic gradient descent via an operation similar to a finite-difference approximation of the gradient. That raises the question of whether non-gradient-based evolutionary algorithms can work at DNN scales. Here we demonstrate they can: we evolve the weights of a DNN with a simple, gradient-free, populationbased genetic algorithm (GA) and it performs well on hard deep RL problems, including Atari and humanoid locomotion. The Deep GA successfully evolves networks with over four million free parameters, the largest neural networks ever evolved with a traditional evolutionary algorithm. These results (1) expand our sense of the scale at which GAs can operate, (2) suggest intriguingly that in some cases following the gradient is not the best choice for optimizing performance, and (3) make immediately available the multitude of neuroevolution techniques that improve performance. We demonstrate the latter by showing that combining DNNs with novelty search, which encourages exploration on tasks with deceptive or sparse reward functions, can solve a high-dimensional problem on which reward-maximizing algorithms (e.g. DQN, A3C, ES, and the GA) fail. Additionally, the Deep GA is faster than ES, A3C, and DQN (it can train Atari in \$\textbackslash sim\$4 hours on one desktop or \$\textbackslash sim\$1 hour distributed on 720 cores), and enables a stateof-the-art, up to 10,000-fold compact encoding technique.},

First, the semantic labels do not provide detailed structural information, making it difficult to synthesize local details and structures.

In this paper, from a return-on-investment point of view, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of this spatially-adaptive normalization and observe that its modulation parameters benefit more from semantic-awareness rather than spatial-adaptiveness, especially for high-resolution input masks. Inspired by this observation, we propose class-adaptive normalization (CLADE), a lightweight but equally-effective variant that is only adaptive to semantic class. In order to further improve spatial-adaptiveness, we introduce intra-class positional map encoding calculated from semantic layouts to modulate the normalization parameters of CLADE and propose a truly spatially-adaptive variant of CLADE, namely CLADE-ICPE. \%Benefiting from this design, CLADE greatly reduces the computation cost while being able to preserve the semantic information in the generation.

For underlying respiratory and circulatory deaths, 90\% of influenza- and 78\% of RSV-associated deaths occurred among persons aged 65 years or older. Influenza was associated with more deaths than RSV in all age groups except for children younger than 1 year. On average, influenza was associated with 3 times as many deaths as RSV.

  abstract = {Machine learning has the potential to identify novel biological factors underlying successful antibody responses to influenza vaccines. The first attempts have revealed a high level of complexity in establishing influenza immunity, and many different cellular and molecular components are involved. Of note is that the previously identified correlates of protection fail to account for the majority of individual responses across different age groups and influenza seasons. Challenges remain from the small sample sizes in most studies and from often limited data sets, such as transcriptomic data. Here we report the creation of a unified database, FluPRINT, to enable large-scale studies exploring the cellular and molecular underpinnings of successful antibody responses to influenza vaccines.

  abstract = {Machine learning has the potential to identify novel biological factors underlying successful antibody responses to influenza vaccines. The first attempts have revealed a high level of complexity in establishing influenza immunity, and many different cellular and molecular components are involved. Of note is that the previously identified correlates of protection fail to account for the majority of individual responses across different age groups and influenza seasons. Challenges remain from the small sample sizes in most studies and from often limited data sets, such as transcriptomic data. Here we report the creation of a unified database, FluPRINT, to enable large-scale studies exploring the cellular and molecular underpinnings of successful antibody responses to influenza vaccines. Over 3,000 parameters were considered, including serological responses to influenza strains, serum cytokines, cell phenotypes, and cytokine stimulations.

Our S2-GAN has two components: the StructureGAN generates a surface normal map; the Style-GAN takes the surface normal map as input and generates the 2D image. Apart from a real vs. generated loss function, we use an additional loss with computed surface normals from generated images. The two GANs are first trained independently, and then merged together via joint learning.

This, in general, could be transferred to a pixel-wise label assignment task, which is quite similar to the structure of hidden Markov random field. In terms of Markov random field, each pixel can be regarded as a state and has a transition probability to its neighbor pixel, the label behind each pixel is a latent variable and has an emission probability from its corresponding state. In this paper, we reviewed several modern image labeling methods based on Markov random field and conditional random Field. And we compare the result of these methods with some classical image labeling methods. The experiment demonstrates that the introduction of Markov random field and conditional random field make a big difference in the segmentation result.},

  abstract = {Most existing methods for object segmentation in computer vision are formulated as a labeling task. This, in general, could be transferred to a pixel-wise label assignment task, which is quite similar to the structure of hidden Markov random field. In terms of Markov random field, each pixel can be regarded as a state and has a transition probability to its neighbor pixel, the label behind each pixel is a latent variable and has an emission probability from its corresponding state. In this paper, we reviewed several modern image labeling methods based on Markov random field and conditional random Field. And we compare the result of these methods with some classical image labeling methods. The experiment demonstrates that the introduction of Markov random field and conditional random field make a big difference in the segmentation result.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing textto-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256\texttimes 256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.},

Previous work seeks to use multiple class-specific generators, constraining its usage in datasets with a small number of classes. We instead propose a novel Group Decreasing Network (GroupDNet) that leverages group convolutions in the generator and progressively decreases the group numbers of the convolutions in the decoder. Consequently, GroupDNet is armed with much more controllability on translating semantic labels to natural images and has plausible high-quality yields for datasets with many classes. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of GroupDNet on performing the SMIS task. We also show that GroupDNet is capable of performing a wide range of interesting synthesis applications. Codes and models are available at: https://github.com/Seanseattle/SMIS.},
